    <h1>Voice</h1>
    <p class="summary">
      IGT’s tone of voice is confident, engaging, smart and dynamic. In our industry, there an abundance of messages, slogans,
      promises of all kinds, all the time. In today’s attention economy, competition to be seen and heard is fierce, making it
      difficult for any company to cut through and build meaningful, enduring brand relationships. When we speak, it’s easier
      for people to notice and understand us if they already recognize our voice.

    <h2>IGT tone attributes</h2>
    <h3>Confident</h3>
    <p>
      We are not arrogant or boastful. We are authentic and responsible, with years of leadership that
      enable us to respond to customers’ needs in clear and understandable language.
    </p>
    <h3>Customer-Focused and Engaging</h3>
    <p>
      We are collaborative and respectful. We convey wit, excitement and exuberance in
      our communications while balancing the need to display a calm, reliability as leader. 
    </p>
    <h3>Dynamic</h3>
    <p>
      We are constantly pioneering uncharted territory on behalf of our
      customers. We question, inquire and observe things others take for granted.
    </p>
    <h2>Confident Writing</h2>
    <p>
      A confident person’s words and speech flow easily. One idea leads naturally to the other. Audiences are intrigued
      and assured when our words connect well. They trust us. They keep reading. Confident people don’t create dependence
      — rather, they empower and inform their audiences with their writing.
    </p>
    <h3>Show, don’t tell.</h3>
    <p>
      Confident writing doesn’t simply say something is true. Showing how something
      is true using specific details communicates our commitment to being a brand of action. 
    </p>
    <h3>Confident people don’t just talk, they do. </h3>
    <p>
      A confident voice uses action verbs instead of linking verbs whenever possible.
      Our confidence comes from our own abilities, not the shortcomings of our competition.
      We talk about our performance in the context of our customers’ needs. In cases where we
      must talk about our performance against competitors, we do so in a factual way.
    </p>
    <p>Our confidence comes from our own abilities, not the shortcomings of our competition.</p>
    <p>
      We talk about our performance in the context of our customers’ needs. In cases where
      we must talk about our performance against competitors, we do so in a factual way.
    </p>
    <h3>Be straightforward.</h3>
    <p>Confident people don’t need to beat around the bush. Neither does confident writing. Speak directly to your audience.</p>
    <h3>Be helpful.</h3>
    <p>Offer valuable information, and prioritize it by leading with key points. Tell audiences what they need to hear up front.</p>
    <h3>Offer more.</h3>
    <p>Provide contact information, links to additional information and anything that enables our audiences to take action.</p>
    <h2>Customer-Focused and engaging writing</h2>
    <p>
      At IGT we don’t follow the trends; we set them. We use language that’s contemporary and
      exciting. We instantly capture our audiences’ interest. We are inviting and intriguing in everything we say.
    </p>
    <h3>Use contemporary, lively language.</h3>
    <p>
      With the exception of the acronyms and business-centric language that our customers
      know and understand, avoid slang and jargon that’s too casual or obscure. 
    </p>
    <h3>Think globally.</h3>
    <p>
      Be aware of the different cultural perspectives of our audiences. Be judicious when using seasonal terms,
      as the world has many seasons at once. Only use colloquialisms that are place-appropriate and address our
      audiences’ different cultural perspectives. 
    </p>
    <h3>Be up-to-date and in the know.</h3>
    <p>
      We’re interesting people. We enjoy the same things our players do. Referencing popular culture
      and style is a good way to connect with our audience and to show that we understand our players and what excites them.
    </p>
    <h3>Subtlety is sophisticated.</h3>
    <p>
      Our audience is intelligent. Don’t point to your conclusions when a simple nod will do.
      Avoid gender bias. Use gender-neutral words such as “workforce” — not “manpower” —“chair” —
      not “chairman” or “chairwoman”. Use “he or she,” or rewrite to avoid gender bias and improper constructions. 
    </p>
    <h3>Get outside your comfort zone.</h3>
    <p>
      Borrow useful language from outside the gaming category to show worldliness and experience.
      Use metaphors, examples and analogies to help people comprehend our message. 
    </p>
    <h3>Use wit when appropriate. </h3>
    <p>
      Engaging copy is about making people smile, not necessarily laughing out loud.
      Surprising copy that creates smiles also creates connections.
    </p>
    <h2>Dynamic writing</h2>
    <p>
      Dynamic writing changes, flows and moves. It breaks out of ruts. Because we often share audiences and mediums with
      competitors, a unique rhythm and cadence will help keep the reader interested while standing out from other companies.
      This is where we get the chance to stand out.
    </p>
    <h3>Vary sentence lengths.</h3>
    <p>
      Don’t be afraid to use even one- or two-word sentences. When we speak, we naturally vary the length of our
      sentences. In writing we do the same. We put fragments or shorter sentences between longer ones. Fragments
      create momentum and direction. Occasionally use a short sentence. Or two. See the difference? 
    </p>
    <h3>Use frequent calls to action to challenge the reader.</h3>
    <p>Examples: “Go further” or “Take your floor to the next level” or “Fast Forward”</p>
    <h3>Ask questions to spark a conversation with readers.</h3>
    <p>
      For example: “What will your lottery retailer look like in five years?” “If your CMS could do one thing, what would it be?”
      “Do you know what your player plays...at home?” Most people are visual thinkers. Use language that illustrates. Choose vivid,
      active words. Use colorful adjectives. Use verbs that represent action, especially ones that “move” more than others: For
      example, “work” is more concrete and human than “operate.” “Build” conveys much more than “leverage.”
    </p>
    <h3>Strike extraneous words.</h3>
    <p>
      Unnecessary words weigh copy down. Take out the words and even whole
      sentences you don’t need. When you’re done, go back again — you’ll find more. 
    </p>
    <h3>Break free of expected language.</h3>
    <p>It’s better to reach one person in 10 with arresting copy than miss everyone because our words blended into the noise.</p>
