    <h1>Imagery</h1>
    <p class="summary">
      A picture is worth a thousand words. Still or motion, IGT imagery should depict real people in real situations in real environments.
      Never contrived, trite, or clichéd, IGT imagery embodies a photojournalistic eye to capture pure moments in the lives of our customers
      and players, and their interactions with one another.

    <h2>Environmental Photography</h2>
    <p>
      Sufficient environmental context without capturing an entire scene, placing products against unobtrusive patterns
      and real settings. They are photographed using the same straightforward angles and lighting as our product photography.

    <h2>Product Photography</h2>
    <p>
      Clear and consistent — silhouetted against white backgrounds. Clear lighting depicts the true colors and textures. Product imagery
      should convey a premium look, with vivid contrast, and sharpness in the details. Straight-on views are often best for capturing
      product families or groupings in a consistent way. Angled views are used to more accurately represent the shape and specific
      features of a product in larger context.

      Sed semper vulputate blandit. Pellentesque eu nisi ut nisl egestas bibendum ac nec sem. Curabitur blandit dignissim ligula, ac
      sollicitudin nibh volutpat non. Fusce condimentum egestas purus nec finibus. Nunc ullamcorper justo sit amet lectus commodo, ac interdum elit convallis.

    <h2>Charts and Graphs</h2>

    <h2>Icons</h2>
    <p>
      When language translation is not practical, icons can be used in multi-lingual communications. Icons communicate information
      simply and clearly without the need for supporting language.

        <h3>Style</h3>
        <p>The preferred icon style is two-dimensional and simple—drawn with a consistent line weight. It should always be designed
          for universal recognition. Icons can be the dominant color of your piece or reversed to white in a color field.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="columns six">
        <h3>Usage</h3>
        <p>
          An icon should visually represent—and therefore replace—the word or phrase describing a specific action or instruction.
          An icon should not be used in addition to the very word or phrase it represents. However, if helpful, a different word
          or phrase can be paired with the icon to add another layer of information (e.g., a horse icon paired with the phrase “sports betting”).
