    <h1>Composition</h1>
    <p class="summary">
      Dynamic and innovative, our compositional style is the foundation of all of our visual communications. Composition helps us
      easily prioritize and organize information in meaningful ways for our customers. It gives our designs a sense of energy and
      movement. And it allows us to use and combine the elements that comprise our brand palette in a grounded, consistent and integrated way.

    <h2>Determining the Grid</h2>
    <p>
      We want to maintain a consistent optical standard for the border and grid throughout all of our communications. The standard
      for borders can range from 2% to 5% of the width of the deliverable, depending on the overall size of your communication piece.
      The grid should be comprised of a series of squares, each of which are 10 to 15% of the width of the deliverable.

    <h2>Determining the Grid — Measurements</h2>
    <p>
      A basic formula determines how to maintain optical
      consistency of the border from small to large executions.

    <h2>Layout Flexibility</h2>
    <p>
      Different communications have different demands. Therefore, a series of layouts are available, each provides a varied
      degree of prominence for the featured product. This insures a strong, consistent framework throughout IGT’s communications.
